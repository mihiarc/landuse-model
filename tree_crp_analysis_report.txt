ECOSYSTEM SERVICES COMPARISON
----------------------------------------
Average ecosystem service score:
  Tree-based practices: 65.7/100
  Non-tree practices: 63.1/100

RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
1. Increase tree-based practices on LCC 1-3 land for maximum carbon benefits
2. Prioritize riparian forest buffers for water quality improvements
3. Use windbreaks on LCC 4-5 land for balanced benefits
4. Maintain grass practices on LCC 6-8 for cost-effectiveness
5. Consider 30-40% tree practices for optimal ecosystem services
